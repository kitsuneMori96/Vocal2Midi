# Vocal2Midi

Vocal2Midi is a Windows-first desktop tool and inference pipeline for turning vocal audio into lyric-aligned MIDI, USTX, and supporting editing artifacts.

The current runtime is **ONNX-first**:

- `llama.cpp` is used for the Qwen decoder and runs on Vulkan or CPU.
- ONNX models default to **DirectML** and fall back to **CPU** when DirectML is unavailable.
- The main user-facing entrypoint is the Fluent GUI in [`app_fluent.py`](app_fluent.py).

## Highlights

- End-to-end vocal-to-MIDI workflow in one project
- Chinese and Japanese lyric handling
- GUI workflow for interactive use
- Batch slice + ASR CLI for folder processing
- Portable-folder packaging flow for Windows distribution
- ONNX-based inference stack for ASR, alignment, note extraction, and RMVPE

## What Vocal2Midi Does

At a high level, the hybrid pipeline looks like this:

```text
audio
  -> optional RMVPE pitch curve
  -> slicing
  -> ASR
  -> lyric matching / .lab generation
  -> HubertFA forced alignment
  -> GAME note extraction
  -> quantization
  -> export
```

There is also a no-lyrics path:

```text
audio
  -> optional RMVPE pitch curve
  -> slicing
  -> GAME pitch-only extraction
  -> export
```

## Runtime Stack

| Component | Current backend | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3-ASR | ONNX Runtime + `llama.cpp` | `inference/qwen3asr_dml/` |
| Japanese mora / romaji ASR | ONNX Runtime | `inference/romaji_asr/` |
| HubertFA | ONNX Runtime | `inference/HubertFA/` |
| GAME | ONNX Runtime | `inference/game/` |
| RMVPE | ONNX Runtime | `inference/API/rmvpe_api.py` |
| Device normalization | DirectML / CPU helpers | `inference/device_utils.py` |

Some public function names still contain `_torch` for compatibility, but the active backend is ONNX-based.

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

Use your preferred Python environment, then install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The main runtime dependencies are:

- `onnxruntime-directml`
- `PyQt5`
- `PyQt-Fluent-Widgets`
- `librosa`
- `soundfile`
- `mido`
- `pyopenjtalk`

An `environment.yml` file is also included as a reference environment snapshot.

### 2. Prepare model folders

By default, the GUI expects models in these locations:

| Component | Default path |
| --- | --- |
| GAME | `experiments/GAME-1.0.3-medium-onnx` |
| HubertFA | `experiments/1218_hfa_model_new_dict` |
| Qwen3-ASR | `experiments/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-dml` |
| Japanese mora ASR | `experiments/romajiASR` |
| RMVPE | `experiments/RMVPE/rmvpe.onnx` |

You can change these paths in the GUI settings panel.

### 3. Launch the GUI

For a normal developer environment:

```bash
python app_fluent.py
```

## GUI Workflow

The GUI is the main way to use Vocal2Midi interactively. It lets you:

- choose model paths
- pick the runtime device
- set slicing mode and slice length bounds
- choose language and lyric output mode
- provide optional reference lyrics
- export MIDI, USTX, text, CSV, chunk audio, and alignment artifacts

The application-layer job entrypoint is `run_auto_lyric_job()` in [`application/pipeline.py`](application/pipeline.py), which dispatches into the hybrid inference pipeline in [`inference/pipeline/auto_lyric_hybrid.py`](inference/pipeline/auto_lyric_hybrid.py).

## Language Behavior

### Chinese

- Qwen3-ASR provides text transcription.
- The lyric matcher and G2P path prepare `.lab` content for HubertFA.
- Lyrics can be exported in Hanzi or pinyin-oriented forms depending on mode.

### Japanese

In the main hybrid lyric pipeline:

- `romaji` and `kana` lyric modes use the dedicated **mora ASR** path
- if the output mode is `romaji`, the pipeline uses mora ASR output directly
- if the output mode is `kana`, the pipeline converts matched mora output to kana for display
- if reference lyrics are provided, the reference text is processed through `pyopenjtalk`, converted to kana mora tokens, then converted again to romaji mora tokens for matching

This keeps Japanese lyric matching consistent with the mora-based ASR path instead of routing through the old phoneme-ASR forced-alignment branch.

## Runtime Device Rules

Visible device options in the current UI are:

- `dml`
- `cpu`

Notes:

- `dml` is the default ONNX device
- if DirectML is unavailable, ONNX Runtime falls back to CPU
- legacy `cuda` values are still accepted by some public interfaces, but they are normalized to `dml`
- `llama.cpp` remains CPU-based in the current design

## Slicing

The user-facing slice duration settings currently support:

- minimum slice length: `0` to `60` seconds
- maximum slice length: `0` to `60` seconds

Current defaults:

- minimum: `8.0` seconds
- maximum: `22.0` seconds

Validation rules:

- `slice_max_sec` must be greater than `0`
- `slice_min_sec` must be less than or equal to `slice_max_sec`

## Batch Slice + ASR CLI

For folder-based batch ASR processing:

```bash
python scripts/slice_asr_cli.py <input_dir> <output_dir> \
  --asr-model experiments/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-dml \
  --device dml \
  --language zh
```

This CLI is focused on:

- scanning input audio files
- slicing audio or bypassing slicing
- running local Qwen3-ASR
- saving chunk audio and `.lab` outputs
- optionally saving JSON timing / ASR metadata

Supported input extensions currently include:

- `.wav`
- `.m4a`
- `.mp3`

Useful options:

```text
--no-slice              bypass slicing and send the whole file to ASR
--asr-batch-size        ASR batch size
--file-batch-size       number of audio files per batch
--rmvpe-model           enable RMVPE-assisted smart slicing
--rmvpe-batch-size      RMVPE batch size
--keep-model            keep the ASR runtime alive across the batch
--keep-rmvpe            keep the RMVPE runtime alive across the batch
--save-json             save slice timing and ASR outputs as JSON
--no-recursive          scan only the top level
--no-skip-existing      force reprocessing of existing outputs
```

Japanese whole-file example:

```bash
python scripts/slice_asr_cli.py input output \
  --asr-model experiments/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B-dml \
  --device dml \
  --language ja \
  --no-slice
```



## Windows Setup Scripts

The repository also includes Windows helper scripts:

- [`install.bat`](install.bat)
- [`run.bat`](run.bat)

These are useful for a smaller distribution model where the user downloads or initializes the runtime on first setup rather than receiving a fully bundled `python/` folder.

## Export Formats

Depending on the selected workflow, Vocal2Midi can export:

- `.mid`
- `.ustx`
- `.txt`
- `.csv`
- `TextGrid`
- chunk `.wav` files
- `.lab`
- ASR matching logs

## Project Notes

- The repository has already migrated away from the earlier Torch-heavy runtime design for the main inference path.
- Some historical function names remain for compatibility.
- Model assets are expected to exist locally under `experiments/` or another user-provided path.
- The codebase is still being cleaned up in places, so you may still see a few legacy names or UI strings from earlier iterations.
